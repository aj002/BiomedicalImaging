Goal: Using ML to advance population-based musculoskeletal biomechanics analyses

Development of better treatment strategies for musculoskeletaldisorders is critically dependent upon our ability to understand variations in mechanics across populations. Statistical shape and intensity models allow capturing such variability in shape and distribution of bone properties throughout the structure.

1. Shape modelling using Gaussian Process Morphable Models: Develop a complete application for establishing a statistical shape model of the
femur; Extend framework to more complex bones such as the pelvis
2. Reconstructing incomplete image data using shape model of the femur 
3. Automate segementation using images and shape data
